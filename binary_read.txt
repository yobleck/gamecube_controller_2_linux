ALL
8 bytes per input (press and release are separate events)
first 4 are time stamp?

struct format i/I hH


BUTTONS
2nd to last 2 indicate release or press
last 2 bytes indicate key id

press = \x01\x00
release = \x00\x00

start = \x01\t
a = \x01\x02
b = \x01\x01
x = \x01\x03
y = \x01\x00
z = \x01\x07
l = \x01\x04
r = \x01\x05


DPAD
2nd to last 2 indicate press/release and direction
press up/left = \x01\x80
press down/right = \xff\x7f
release = \x00\x00

last 2 indicate up/down or left/right but not which one
up/down = \x02\x05
left/right = \x02\x04


CSTICK
up and down dont work?
press/release same as buttons
last 2 bytes same as buttons

cup = 
cdwn = 
clft = \x01\x06
crght = \x01\x08


JOYSTICK
same as dpad
2nd to last 2 indicate press/release and direction
press up/left = \x01\x80
press down/right = \xff\x7f
release = \x00\x00

last 2 indicate up/down or left/right but not which one
up/down = \x02\x05
left/right = \x02\x04


ISSUES
no cstick up/down
joystick and dpad have identical outputs
dpad spams press/release. hardware issues?
